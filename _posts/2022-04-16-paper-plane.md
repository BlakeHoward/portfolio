# About

This is a short video of me making a delicioius whiskey-based cocktail called the Paper Plane. You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdzB105gT9Q).

This is the first video I made with the Canon C70. It's also the first video I made using a camera that shoots a log profile (C-Log3 specifically, but I'll just call it log). This resulted in a bit of a learning curve since I then had to figure out how to color my footage. Once I got the hang of using Davinci Resolve, I was stunned with the colors that could be pulled from the defualt, greyish log footage. I also love the narrow depth of field that was possible with the C70 and the lens I used, the RF 35mm F1.8 Macro. Close-ups of equipment such as the glass I poured the drink into and the liquor bottles had an isolated, crisp look, which I am a fan of.

 All in all, I'm happy with this video, but there are things I would do differently.

# Lessons Learned

###  Remember to check your profile before shooting


Since I was so new to shooting in log, I would frequently switch back and forth from it to Rec. 709 in order to see how my colors look. Several times I would forget to switch back to log and record a whole section of the video in the wrong profile. Sometimes only realizing it when I got to editing, which sucked. 

One solution to this is to not be an idiot and just switch back to log, Blake. Another is to get a field monitor that you can program a LUT into so that the camera still records in log, but you see nice colors in the monitor. This costs money though, which I didn't feel like spending.

At the end I reshot stuff, which was a hassle, but necessary.


### Plan Plan Plan your shots

I can't overstate how crucial it is to plan out your shot schedule before the day that shooting takes place. I really can't. It saves so many resources. It saves everyone's time and energy, and it also saves your credibility as a director. 

For this video in particular, I scheduled about half of the shots before hand, the ones I predicted to be more difficult, and left the others to be essentially improvised. When the time came to shoot the unplanned ones, I had to pivot from my more technical "lights go here," "this lens on," "pull focus here"  mode, to a more relaxed, creative mode in order to see what shot would fit well logically and artistically (*eye-roll*) around the others that were already set in stone. 

Unforunatley for me, I was the only one working on this video, so I didn't have to pleasure of wasting other people's time, just my own. But moving forward, and planning on working with others, I can't afford to stop and plan a shot with this level of heads-down focus after everything was just go, go, go. It interrupts the inertia of everyone working on the set, and it takes away from your focus as a director to execute what was already planned and fix unexpected problems that pop up. And they will pop up.

Plan every shot, at least at a minimum, before the day of shooting.

# Conclusion

This was a fun video to plan, shoot, and edit. While my primary passion lies in narritve filmmaking, drinking is my secondary passion, which made this production enjoyable, along with expoloring a new camera, lens, and editing software. Although I made some mistakes, I've learned from them and will take that knowledge to my next project.
